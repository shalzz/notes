# Harberger Tax

As known as Common Ownership Self-assessed Tax (COST) where individual
property owners decide the value of the property/land they own based on their
own self-assessment and then pay the property tax or Harberger Tax on the value
they declare on the property.

However, here anyone can then propose to buy the property for the declared value
amount. Here the rules are not clear as whether the property owner **has** to sell
the property on a valid proposal and what will be the terms of transfer (time period, 
depreciation, insurance, defacement/vandalism of the property) or the owner
refuses to sell, then perhaps there's a re-evaluation of the properties value
by the proposer.
