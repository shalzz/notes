# Solidity Vulnerabilities
#osint

* Re-Entrancy
    * External contract, address call()
    * Check - Effects - Interaction

* Arithmetic over/underflows
* Unexpected Ether
    * Pre-computing addresses
    * selfdestruct
    * mine

* Delegate Call
    * Storage Slots
    
* Default Visibility
* Libraries
    * Define address as constant when using a library contract
    * Or use internal functions so that solidity can replace inline and does
        modify state.
        * Uses JUMP and not DELEGATECALL

* Unchecked CALL

* DOS Attack
    * External calls without gas stipends
        * Low gas amount to DOS/Censor
        * No gas limit/stipend causing someone to consume all gas.
    * Looping through unbounded arrays

* Hash Collision with multiple variable length arguments.
    * Do no allow users access to parameters with `abi.encodePacked()`
    * Use fixed length arrays
    * Or used `abi.encoded`

* Signature Replay Attack
    * Signature Malleability

* Common Mistakes
    * Update a variable/receiver but fail to invalidate the previous owner/sender.
