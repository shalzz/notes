# Consultant

## Flavours

* Contracting: One project at a time. Mainly technical than personal.
* Consulting: Multiple costumers at a time. More about long-term relationship
  than a specific project.

## How
* Technical skills are not the biggest asset. Maxim: Give the customer with
  the "warm fuzzy feeling".
* Maxim: Trust is your best job security.

## Job Security
None

## Cash Flow
* net-10 terms i.e. payment due within 10 days of the invoice.
* Soft net-10; usually around 10-15 days.
* Asking for a stale invoice to be paid is fine,
    but it's exceptionally bad business to give the customer any
    hint that you're in a bad place.
