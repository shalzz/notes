## Ideas
[Consulting Ideas](x2f9)

## Flavours

* Contracting: One project at a time. Mainly technical than personal.
* Consulting: Multiple costumers at a time. More about long-term relationship
  than a specific project.

## How
* Technical skills are not the biggest asset. Maxim: Give the customer with
  the "warm fuzzy feeling".
* Maxim: Trust is your best job security.

## Job Security
None

## Cash Flow
* net-10 terms i.e. payment due within 10 days of the invoice.
* Soft net-10; usually around 10-15 days.
* Asking for a stale invoice to be paid is fine,
    but it's exceptionally bad business to give the customer any
    hint that you're in a bad place.

## Customer Relationship
* Have customers and not clients
  * Maxim: You are primarily in the *customer service* business, not the *technical business*
* Be easy to find

## Billing
### Hourly billing
* Best for ill-defined or occasional work.
* Customer bears the brunt of the project run-off and is at the mercy of the
  consultant for being fair.
* Not preferred by clients due to project-creep and "[churning](cpwn)"

* Never ever lie or fudge on an invoice.
* Provide time-billing transparency: List what you *did* and *who* asked you do it in detail.
* Give away some free time, but make it visible.
* Admit your mistakes.
