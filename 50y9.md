# Permaculture Code of Architecture and Building

- Buildings should not be higher than trees.
- Should use locally sourced building material considering the ecological cost.
- No air conditioning system or architecture designed around artificial temperature control. (i.e. prefer passive solar design)
- Prefer building public transport and infrastructure underground (subway, pedestrian underpass, electricity and water lines)
- Adopt and integrate solar punk designs into public infra and buildings (sidewalks,  major 4-wheeler roads, water canals and bicycle lanes)
- Non-asphalt roads (for water permeability, no extreme thermal variance from the environment, preferably cobble-stone roads)
