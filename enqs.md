Working with a co-founder is like optimizing for a 10-year relationship

## What we fight about?

## Four Horsemen

Things to avoid in a fight

* Contempt
Intention to insult
Avoid making things personal.

* Defensiveness 
Not owning responsibility about a problem, not admitting there is a problem.

* Stonewalling
Walks away from a problem 

## Make a plan before you fight

* Divide and conquer
> Divide up the tasks by assigning roles/areas of ownership
> Determine what is success and failure

* Know Thyself
What is your attachment style:
    1. Secure (Being vulnerable without and within others)
    1. Anxious (Not getting enougth love/attention) (Needs validation)
    1. Avoidant (Scared / wants to runaway since relationship are hard or can
       mess up) (Need space)

* Document a Process
Create a process for dealing with disagreements.

* Use Non-Violent Communication
   - Focus on universal needs

* Requests Vs Demand
Make requests instead of demands
   * Make it specific
   * Say what you want
   * Stay curious
