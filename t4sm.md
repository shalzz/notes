# Borrow Checker
#rust

One of which is borrow checking at compile time, a mechanism providing memory safe
operations/programming via automatic reference counting of used variables/memory
that removes the need for manual memory allocation
and free-ing of memory by a programmer as well as any need for an garbage collector
as a way of automatic memory management.
