# Community led Product building

Build an audience first before you build your product. 

Start with a:
* Newsletter
* Podcast
* Youtube channel

## Craft a mission statement. Create a manifesto. 
Why do you gather?
What's your mission?
What are your core values?
What problems do you solve together?

## Build communities
Create rituals. Host standups, meetups, co-building sessions and retreats to form
bonds and productive habits.
That's how we build compounding relationships between community members.
