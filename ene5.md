# Flag Theory

A way of living where one distributes his wealth and time across multiple geographic
jurisdictions in order to better project himself, his wealth and his family from
political instability, natural emergencies or anything that can be hedged against
by being location-independent.

It also has the benefit of leveraging jurisdictional arbitrate for:
    * Tax optimisation
        * Not staying in one jurisdiction for more than 3-4 months automatically
          relieves you of being a tax resident.
    * Cost of living
    * Job market and compensation
