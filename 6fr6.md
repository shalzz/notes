# Oracle

An oracle is the ability to provide information about a system (could be the
real world) to another system that is outside its bounds.

For example in Blockchains, an oracle is used to provide information about
the real world to smart contracts that only have information about its
internal system/computers.

Desired property:
* [Objective Truth](ybkw) 

* [Simplest Trustworthy Oracle](4kia)
