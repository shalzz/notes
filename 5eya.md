# CAP Theorem

* Consistency
* Availability
* Partition Tolerance

## Consistency-Availability Trade Off

We live in a physical world and cannot guarantee the stability of a network
and thus a *distributed* database must choose Partition Tolerance (P).
This means a trade-off between Consistency (C) and Availability (A).
