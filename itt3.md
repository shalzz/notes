# Remote work culture

Since the proliferation of remote work, many companies have taken an aggressive stance
to maintain some oversight on their employees by focusing on
metrics such as working hours and responsiveness to company chat/email.
Instead of the long fought for and established de-facto standards of
an employee's quality of work done and the meeting of project deadlines,
irrespective of individual time spent working as the true metric of an employee's productivity.
