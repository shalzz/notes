# Perfect Insurance

The insurance is redeemable anytime the recipient feels like it should be.
    - Users become habituated to extending stakes/bonds/“permissions to spend”/trustlines
        (verbiage refinement is important) to people they trust, in an amount
        never exceeding the amount the other person values the relationship.
    - Users lock/withdraw the amount of funds they would like insured along
        the maximal flow of trustlines from the oracle to themselves.
    - User client software is capable of presenting evidence of wrongdoing
        to users in the case of arbitration.

Another name for optimistic systems?
