# Hara centering

## When
In the night, when you go to sleep/first thing in the morning.


### Step 1: Locate the Hara
Lie down on the bed and put both your hand two inches below you naval and press a little.

### Step 2: Take a Deep breath
Start breathing, deep breathing. You will feel that center coming up and down with the breathing. Feel your whole energy while there as if you are shrinking and shrinking and you are just existing there as a small center, very concentrated energy.

### Step 3: Center while you sleep
Fall asleep doing it - that will be helpful. Then the whole night that centering persists. Again and again the unconscious goes and center there. So the whole night without your knowing, you will be coming in many ways in deep contact with the center.

### Step 4: Reconnect with the Hara
In the morning, the moment that you feel that sleep has gone, don't open your eyes first. Again put your hands there, push a little, start breathing; again feel the Hara. Do this for 10-5 minutes and then get up.
