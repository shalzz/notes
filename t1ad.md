# SQL vs NoSQL DB

## Relational Databases (SQL)
Are structured and have predefined schemas.

## Non-relational Databases
Are unstructured, distributed and have a dynamic schema.

## High level differences

|Property| SQL | NoSQL|
|--------|-----|------|
|Storage | Data stored in tables| Different data storage models such as document, key-value, graph and column-oriented (used mainly for analytics)|
|Schema| Fixed | Dynamic|
|Query| SQL language| queries based on documents and have different syntax/DSL by DB|
|Scalability| Vertical| Horizontal|
|Reliability| ACID | Non-ACID for performance and scalability|

## Reasons

### For SQL
* Structured data with strict schema
* Relational data
* Need for complex joins
* Transactions
* Lookups by index are very fast

### For NoSQL

* Dynamic or flexible schema
* Non-relational data
* No need for complex joins
* Very data-intensive workload
* Very high throughput for IOPS
